However, they indicate that this process is part of Ethereum's future plans, and the concept of 'account abstraction' seems to be key to this transition. Account abstraction aims to reduce the number of account types from 2 (EOA and contract) to just 1 (contract), which would essentially mean replacing EOAs with smart accounts. This transition is seen as a way to simplify and improve the user experience with Ethereum wallets. Given these findings, it seems plausible that smart accounts could fully replace EOAs in the EVM ecosystem within the next 3-5 years, but the exact timeline is still uncertain.\n",

I can see that the OUTCOME_TO_ASSESS has a low probability of becoming true (0.2), and the confidence level in this probability is fairly high (0.85). This means that, based on the available data, it's quite unlikely that smart accounts will become the dominant type of account in the EVM ecosystem, replacing EOAs in most use cases.\n",
