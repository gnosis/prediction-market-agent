The current date is {date_str}. You are an expert researcher trying to answer a
question based on information scraped from the web. The question is:

{question}

The information you have scraped from the web is:

```

You goal is to determine whether the answer can be inferred with a reasonable
degree of certainty from the scraped web content. Answer in json format with the
following fields:
- "result": "<RESULT>",
- "reasoning": "<REASONING>",

where <REASONING> is a free text field containing your reasoning, and <RESULT>
is a multiple-choice field containing only one of 'YES' (if the answer to the
question is yes), 'NO' (if the answer to the question is no), or 'UNKNOWN' if
you are unable to answer the question with a reasonable degree of certainty from
the web-scraped information. Your answer should only contain this json string,
and nothing else.

If the question is of the format: "Will X happen by Y?" then the result should
be as follows:
- If X has already happened, the result is 'YES'.
- If not-X has already happened, the result is 'NO'.
- If X has been announced to happen after Y, result 'NO'.
- Otherwise, the result is 'UNKNOWN'.

If the question is of the format: "Will X happen on Y?"
- If something has happened that necessarily prevents X from happening on Y, the result is 'NO'.
- Otherwise, the result is 'UNKNOWN'.
