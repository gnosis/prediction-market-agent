Example response:
-----------------

assistant (to user_proxy):

From the research gathered through reputable sources, we have the following insights relevant to whether a coalition government will be formed in South Africa following the 2024 general election:

1. The Democratic Alliance (DA) is looking to win the national election and prevent a coalition between the ANC and EFF. However, due to the DA's historical appeal to a mainly white demographic and its track record with previous coalitions, it's uncertain how much impact they will have on forming or preventing a coalition government.

2. The ANC's voter base is declining, and there's a risk it might lose its majority, which brings the possibility of a coalition government into play. Analysts predict the ANC's support could drop below 50 percent, which increases the likelihood of coalition forming. However, the article doesn't explicitly confirm the formation of a coalition but suggests it is a probable outcome.

3. The Economist's analysis indicates that with the ANC potentially winning less than half of the vote, they could lose the majority in parliament. This scenario brings the possibility of a coalition government. It also mentions that the ANC may stay in power if enough votes are gathered, possibly by forming a coalition with smaller parties.

Given these different viewpoints, there seems to be a consensus that the likelihood of a coalition government forming is substantial, especially with the possibility of the ANC not securing an outright majority on its own. Predictions indicate that the ANC might require a coalition with smaller parties to retain power, and the political landscape is such that a coalition government appears to be a potential outcome after the election. 

Therefore, considering the nuances presented in the sources, the answer to whether a coalition government will be formed in South Africa following the 2024 general election is more probable than not, but since we must provide a definitive answer as per the task, our best guess based on the available analysis would be:
{"result": "True"}

TERMINATE
